## Experience

**Snyk.io, London** (Jan 2017 to May 2020)  
**People Operations Lead**
-
(Snyk’s mission is to help developers use open source code and stay secure)

During my time at Snyk, I helped to support the company's growth from 15 employees to over 300, across multiple global locations.

My role at Synk began in 2017 as a founding memeber of the People Team, supporting and establishing multiple responsiblites including, but not limited to: office management, financial reporting and Executive Assistant to the Founder/CEO.

During the scaling of both the company and People Team, I focused my skills to be more systems based, by further establishing our HRIS and project leading the company's new employee onboarding workflows. This naturally lead to me, from 2019, leading People Operations where I owned employee data integrity, reporting and automation from within our HRIS; working closely with the legal, IT and engineering teams.
